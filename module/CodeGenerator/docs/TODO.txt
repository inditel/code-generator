PHASE 1
* How to configure the generator
* Command line interface!
* Generate Entity classes
* Generate TableGateway classes (fieldset, input filters should be able to add methods of their own)
* Generate Fieldset classes (auto-complete fields, automatic query generation)
* Generate InputFilter classes (filters, validators for inArray type validations and auto-complete fields)
* Generate service_manager config
* Generate language files for keys that require translations.

PHASE 2 - Generating these should be conditional and using a config file. These are code bases that will be altered.
* Generate controllers?
* Generate forms?
* Generate services?



BIG QUESTIONS?
* How can this tool be used with MongoDB? Probably can't, as there is no real structure...
